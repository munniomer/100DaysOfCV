## Additional Rules
1. I will tweet about my progress every day -> using the hashtag #100DaysOfMLCode #30DaysOfUdacity
2. If I code at work, that time won't count towards the challenge.
3. I will push code to GitHub every day so that anyone can see my progress.
4. I will update the (Log)[log.md] with the day's progress and provide a link so that others can see my progress.
5. I will work on real projects, facing real challenges.
