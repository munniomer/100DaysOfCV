### Day 1: Nov 11, 2019
**Today's Progress:** I watched the first **8 videos** and went through the **Images as Numerical Data Notebook** of lesson 4 of Computer vision Nanodegree which is all about Image representation and Classification.

**Thoughts**: I learned how computers see images , how to Read images and Print out their dimensions and also how to Change images from color to grayscale

### Day 2: Nov 12, 2019
**Today's Progress:** Learned about color images and how they are seen by computers, also practiced how to visualize RGB Channels.

**Thoughts** Learned that color images contain more information than grayscale images and they can add unneccessary complexity and take up more space in memory. Also learned when is color important ?
